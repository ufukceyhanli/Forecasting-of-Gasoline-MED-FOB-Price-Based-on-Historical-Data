### Business Problem
Production planning and process scheduling is one of the most important parts of refineries for maximizing the profit of production. Although there are many inputs to optimize this problem, gasoline crack margin is one of most cruical variable for making production planning decisions in refineries. In this project, I am going to predict gasoline crack margin by using time series data downloaded from Platts platform.
